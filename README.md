This repository contains the R markdown implementation of the final project for the course 'Introduction to Machine Learning in R' by Prof Joseph Yurko as part of academic Credit.

Project Details: The final project for my machine learning course was sponsored by PPG Industries which is a fortune 500 Company, headquartered in Pittsburgh.  PPG has given me the opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to study their data on Paint Colors and  to see if machine learning techniques can learn patterns associated with top selling paint colors.
